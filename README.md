# Single-Variable Linear Regression: YouTube Views Prediction

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of single-variable linear regression to predict YouTube video views based on the number of videos uploaded. The model uses only 5 data samples for simplicity and visualizes the results with Matplotlib.

## Features

- **Single-variable linear regression:** Predict views using the number of videos as input.
- **Simple and educational:** Easy to understand for beginners in machine learning.
- **Visualization:** Displays the relationship between videos and views using Matplotlib.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python installed with the following libraries:
   - `numpy`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `sklearn`
3. Open and run the `single_variable.ipynb` file to train the model and visualize the results.

## Sample Output

The program plots a graph with:
- X-axis: Number of videos (`plt.xlabel('videos')`)
- Y-axis: Predicted views (`plt.ylabel('views')`)

## Ideal For

- Beginners learning linear regression.
- Small-scale experiments and educational demonstrations.
